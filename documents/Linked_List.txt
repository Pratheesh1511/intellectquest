Linked List Module Documentation
================================

Introduction
------------
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element is a separate object called a "node" that contains data and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence.

Concepts and Definitions
------------------------
- **Node**: An individual part of a linked list containing the data and the link to the next node.
- **Head**: The first node in a linked list.
- **Tail**: The last node in a linked list, which points to NULL.

Use Cases
---------
- Implementing stacks, queues, graphs, and other complex data structures.
- Dynamic memory allocation where the size of the data structure can change over time.

Best Practices
--------------
- Use a dummy head node to simplify insertion and deletion operations at the beginning of the list.
- Double-check edge cases, such as inserting at the beginning or end of the list or when the list is empty.
