Backtracking Algorithm Module Documentation
===========================================

Introduction
------------
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally and removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

Implementation
--------------
It is used for solving constraint satisfaction problems like puzzles, crosswords, and Sudoku.

Use Cases
---------
- N-Queens problem.
- Hamiltonian cycles.

Best Practices
--------------
- Use backtracking when you need to explore all potential solutions and choose the best one according to the problem's constraints.
