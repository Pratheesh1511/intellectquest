Searching Algorithm Module Documentation
========================================

Introduction
------------
Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve information stored within some data structure or computed in the problem domain. They are essential for solving problems related to data retrieval and manipulation.

Concepts and Definitions
------------------------
- **Linear Search**: Iterates through a data structure or list, comparing each element with the target value until a match is found or the end is reached.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient approach for sorted data sets, dividing the data set in half and recursively searching for the target value.

Implementation
--------------
```python
# Linear Search Implementation
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Binary Search Implementation
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > target:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```

Use Cases
---------
- Database searching operations.
- Searching for a record in a file.
- Implementations in sorting algorithms.

Best Practices
--------------
- Choose the appropriate searching algorithm based on the data set. Use binary search for sorted data to achieve better performance.
- Consider the time and space complexity of the algorithm, especially for large data sets.
