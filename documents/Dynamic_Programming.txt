Dynamic Programming Module Documentation
========================================

Introduction
------------
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable where the problem can be divided into stages, with a decision required at each stage that will affect subsequent stages.

Implementation
--------------
Techniques involve memoization or bottom-up approach to store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.

Use Cases
---------
- Calculating the nth Fibonacci number.
- Finding the shortest path in a graph.

Best Practices
--------------
- Identify if a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure to apply dynamic programming.
- Use tabulation or memoization to store intermediate results.
