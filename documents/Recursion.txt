Recursion Module Documentation
==============================

Introduction
------------
Recursion is a method of solving problems where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

Implementation
--------------
Recursion involves the concept of a base case and a recursive case. It is widely used in algorithms like sorting, searching, and tree traversals.

Use Cases
---------
- Calculating factorials.
- Fibonacci sequence.

Best Practices
--------------
- Ensure the recursion has a base case.
- Be aware of stack overflow issues with deep recursion.
