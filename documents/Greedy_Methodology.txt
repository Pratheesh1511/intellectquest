Greedy Methodology Module Documentation
=======================================

Introduction
------------
The greedy methodology is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

Implementation
--------------
Greedy algorithms are used in optimization problems, such as finding the minimum spanning tree (Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms) and in scheduling problems.

Use Cases
---------
- Resource allocation problems.
- Huffman coding for data compression.

Best Practices
--------------
- Greedy algorithms are most effective when a local optimum is also a global optimum, so it's important to choose the right problems.
